I would like to study and work on the representation of knowledge.  
  
I have some enthusiast experience in data analytics and a passion for data visualization.  
  
Data storytelling has stood out to me as an exciting form of sharing information with pathos.  
  
I have recently gained an interest for how knowledge can be represented in different graphical formats.  
For example: a small pamphlet laying out theory of mind simply for anyone near a high school education to understand.  
  
Virtual reality and augmented reality seem very promising for this type of research and development.  
The goal would be to explore and understand methods of sharing knowledge in a 3-dimensional environment.  
  
Gestures like motion, as well as the 3-dimensions would be available. Time would play an interesting role in sequences.
