## Now  

I have had a hard time being myself lately. It has been a challenge to even understand a lot of who I am, what I am doing, or what I have been going through.  

I do feel a strong affinity for purpose - a desire to take part in something greater than myself.  
I have a desire to help others, teach, and to help prepare the problems of today for the problem solvers of tomorrow.  
I am facinated with the representation of knowledge and information. For instance: how could one properly describe a theory of mind in a brief pamphlet that anyone with a high school education could understand. I also love data visualization and data story telling.
